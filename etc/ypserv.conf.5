.TH YPSERV.CONF 5 "April 2002" "YP Server" "Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
ypserv.conf - configuration file for ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ypserv.conf
is an ASCII file which contains some options for ypserv. It also
contains a list of rules for special host and map access for ypserv
and rpc.ypxfrd. This file will be read by ypserv and rpc.ypxfrd at
startup, or when receiving a SIGHUP signal.

There is one entry per line. If the line is a option line,
the format is:
.IP
option: [yes|no]
.LP
The line for an access rule has the format:
.IP
host:domain:map:security
.LP
All rules are tried one by one. If no match is found, access to a
map is allowed.

Following
.I options
exist:
.TP
.B xfr_check_port
With this option enabled, the NIS master server have to run on a
port < 1024. The default is "yes" (enabled).
.TP
.B trusted_master
This option expects a different argument than the other above. The argument
is the FQDN of the master host. If this option is set on a slave server,
new maps from this host as master will be accepted. The default is, that
no trusted master is set and new maps will not be accepted.
.br
Example:
.br
trusted_master: ypmaster.example.org
.LP
The field descriptions for the access rule lines are:
.TP
.B host
IP address. Wildcards are allowed.

.SH WARNINGS
The access rules for special maps are no real improvement in security,
but they make the life a little bit harder for a potential hacker.
.SH BUGS
Solaris clients don't use privileged ports. All security options
which depend on privileged ports cause big problems on Solaris clients.
